<h4 id="statistics-canada-data-science-division-1">Statistics Canada · Data Science Division</h4>
<p>In this position, I was acting as the senior software developer on an 18-month cloud-native redesign of the data processing system for a large statistical program Statistics Canada. From May 2021 to July 2021, I worked directly under the project technical lead, and from August 2021 to March 31, 2022 I acted as the technical lead for the project. The project was delivered successfully (feature-complete, on-time, and at a cost significantly lower than the next best alternative) on March 31, 2022. Listed below were my primary duties in this position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supervise the work of other developers</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Supervised the work of 6 different developers (not all at the same time), where each developer focused on implementing a different aspect of the system.</li>
<li>Provided technical advisory for the project’s developers on issues related to software design, code implementation, debugging, testing, and documentation.</li>
<li>Chaired daily stand-up meetings with the developers, the projects’ clients, and subject matter experts to ensure that the project’s deliverables were on track.</li>
<li>Managed bi-weekly project milestones and project Gitlab issues, ensuring that project goals were met according to specifications in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Design and implement several cloud-native components of the system redesign</strong></p>
